    <description>A tiny c# utility for calculating work days and work time. The code is written in .NET C#.

      The tool is useful for calculate difference between two dates of workdays, to plan projects excluding holidays and absences. Is also a simple starting-point to addons to estimate the date of the end of a job.

      The application works only counting the dates forward and it is assumed that the date entered as the first parameter is a working day.</description>
